# nico-kow's CapRover One-Click-Apps

This is my personal collection of one-click-apps that I use on my [CapRover](https://caprover.com/) instance.  

Feel free to use my them on your own server!  
Just add `https://nico-kow.github.io/caprover-one-click-apps` to your 3rd party repositories at the bottom of the one-click-app page.

You can identify my personal apps with the `(nico-kow)` suffix.  
I focus on productive usage with CapRover. One of the most missing part is for me the ability to properly backup the one-click-apps of caprover. This is the first thing i want to tackle with this repo.
